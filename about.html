                <h2>Sumeru Akademiya or GenshinPlace (TGP)</h2>
                <p>The Genshin Place, or TGP, formed during Reddit's r/place. An April Foolâ€™s event that brought together all corners of the internet. More information on what happened during r/place and the formation of this community may be found <a href="rplace.html">here</a>.<br><br>

                    In the aftermath of r/place, the community that had formed held much potential. This potential was taken and molded into a niche that was not yet found in many other Genshin-related spaces. The Genshin community did many things, however, a community to go and talk about lore specifically had not yet taken off. TGP was meant to fill that niche and allow fellow Genshin players a community to have easy access to Genshin-related lore.<br><br>
                    
                    Learning more about the lore of any video game is a tedious task to behold. TGP was meant to allow that knowledge to be more comprehensive and attainable. A convenient way to learn more about one's favorite game.<br><br>
                    
                    We at TGP aim to create an environment that allows for an undemanding access point for the average Genshin player to gain the tools needed to take a deep dive into lore and theory-crafting.<br><br>
