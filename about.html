                <h2>Sumeru Akademiya or GenshinPlace (TGP)</h2>
                <p>We are a group of Genshin Impact players who originally came together during Reddit's r/place april fools event.<sup><a href="index">[1]</a></sup><br><br>
                In the aftermath of the event, we didn't want to waste our community's potential, and searched for something that the genshin community was missing. The lore in Genshin is vast and fairly niche in the broader playerbase, and one of the reasons we thought that was because Genshin lore is difficult to get in to.<br><br>
                We aim to create an environment that makes it as easy as possible for the average Genshin player to have the tools they need to dive deep into lore and theorycrafting.</p>
